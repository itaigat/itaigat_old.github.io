The ACM DEBS 2018 Grand Challenge focuses on (soft) real-time prediction of both the destination port and the time of arrival of vessels, monitored through the Automated Identification System (AIS). Venilia prediction mechanism is based on a variety of machine learning techniques, including Markov predictive models. To improve the accuracy of a model, trained off-line on historical data, Venilia supports also on-line continuous training using an incoming event stream. The software architecture enables a low latency, highly parallelized, and load balanced prediction pipeline. Aiming at a portable and reusable solution, Venilia is implemented on top of the Akka Actor framework. Finally, Venilia is also equipped with a visualization tool for data exploration.
